# What is this work about?
This is an implementation to extract text complexity features. 

# What do you need to run the code?
* To get the requirements run:  `$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

# How to extract the text complexity features?
This script extracts surface, syntactic, pos tag, lexical, temporal, semantic and
discourse relevant features related to text complexity. The extracted features are
stored in a CSV file. The script can be used in the command line. The parameters
to be specified are the path to the folder containing the texts from which the
features are to be extracted. And the name of the file in which the results are to
be saved.
* Extract the text complexity features: `$ python extract_features.py  -p "dir_to_data/" -o "output_file_name"`
* `"dir_to_data/"` should be a path to the directory with files containing texts
* `"output_file_name"` is the file path you want to safe the results in.

# Want to have a quick insight?
* Get a demo of the features extraction with: `$ python extract_features.py -d True`
